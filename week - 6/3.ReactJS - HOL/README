##  Objectives

###  Explain React Components
React components are independent, reusable pieces of UI. They let you split the UI into isolated pieces that can be rendered separately.

---

###  Differences Between Components and JavaScript Functions

| React Components             | JavaScript Functions            |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Return JSX (UI)              | Return data or perform logic    |
| Can maintain internal state  | Do not have state by default    |
| Use lifecycle methods        | No lifecycle management         |

---

###  Types of Components
1. Class Components
2. Function Components

---

###  Explain Class Component
- Uses ES6 class syntax
- Can hold state and lifecycle methods
'```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Home extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Welcome to the Home page of Student Management Portal</h2>;
  }
}'

---

###  Explain Function Component

A **function component** in React is a plain JavaScript function that returns JSX (HTML-like syntax). It’s the simplest way to define a component.

**Example:**
'```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, welcome to React!</h1>;
}'

Does not have its own state (before React 16.8).
Can use hooks like useState() and useEffect() (from React 16.8 onwards).
Ideal for simple and presentational components.

## Define Component Constructor

The **constructor** is a special method used in class components to:

* Initialize state
* Bind methods to the component

**Syntax:**

jsx
Copy
Edit
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {
    name: 'StudentApp'
  };
}
Note: super(props) is required to access this.props in the constructor.

---

## Define render() Function

The **render() function** is mandatory in class components. It returns the JSX that should be displayed on the screen.

**Example:**

jsx
Copy
Edit
class Home extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Welcome to the Home page</h2>;
  }
}

**Key Points:**

Can return only one parent element (use a <div> or <> fragment wrapper).

Is called whenever the component’s state or props change.
