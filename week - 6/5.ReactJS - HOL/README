###  Understanding the Need for Styling React Components

Styling in React is essential to build visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. It helps to:
- Improve user experience
- Organize and format content clearly
- Convey branding, meaning, and state (e.g., color for status)

React allows several ways to style components, such as:
- Traditional CSS
- Inline styles
- CSS Modules
- Styled-components (via third-party libraries)

Here, we explore **CSS Modules** and **inline styles**.

###  Working with CSS Modules and Inline Styles

**CSS Modules** allow scoped styling, meaning styles defined in one component wonâ€™t affect others. This prevents class name collisions and makes component-level styling modular and manageable.

**Inline styles** are useful for applying dynamic styles conditionally using JavaScript logic.

> Example in this project:
> - CSS Module is used for layout and card styling (`.box` class).
> - Inline style is used to apply color based on cohort status or category.

This combination ensures clean design and flexibility while keeping the components reusable and easy to maintain.
