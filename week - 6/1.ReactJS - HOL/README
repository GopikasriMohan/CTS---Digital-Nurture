##  Objectives

###  Define SPA and Its Benefits
**SPA (Single Page Application)** is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without refreshing the page.

**Benefits:**
- Fast navigation
- Improved user experience
- Reduced server load
- Seamless transitions

---

###  Define React and Identify Its Working
**React** is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

**How it works:**
- Uses reusable **components**
- Utilizes a **virtual DOM** to track UI changes
- Efficiently updates the real DOM only where necessary

###  Differences Between SPA and MPA

| SPA (Single Page App)         | MPA (Multi Page App)            |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Loads a single page           | Loads new pages on each request |
| Faster navigation             | Slower due to full reloads      |
| Uses JavaScript for routing   | Uses server-side routing        |
| Example: Gmail                | Example: Amazon                 |

###  Pros & Cons of SPA

**Pros:**
- Fast and fluid experience
- Fewer server requests
- Reusable components

### âœ… Explain About React
React helps developers build fast and interactive UIs. It is component-based, declarative, and follows a unidirectional data flow.

---

### âœ… Define Virtual DOM
The **Virtual DOM** is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. React updates the virtual DOM first and uses a diffing algorithm to apply only the necessary changes to the real DOM, improving performance.

### âœ… Features of React
- Component-Based Architecture
- Virtual DOM
- JSX Syntax
- Unidirectional Data Flow
- Performance Optimization
- Strong Community Support
