UNDERSTAND ASYMPTOTIC NOTATION

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. It simplifies complex problems by breaking them down into base cases and recursive cases.

In financial forecasting, recursion can be used to model compound growth, where each year’s value depends on the previous year’s value. This mirrors the natural, repeating structure of compound interest or annual percentage growth.

Example:
To compute future value:
FV = PV × (1 + rate) ^ years
This can be broken recursively as:
FV(years) = FV(years - 1) × (1 + rate)

ANALYSIS

**Time Complexity**
A simple recursive approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of years. This is because each year involves one recursive call.

**Optimization**
To avoid excessive computation:

Use memoization if there are overlapping subproblems (not typical in this case).

For power calculations like (1 + rate)^n, use Exponentiation by Squaring, which reduces time complexity to O(log n).
