**SME to explain the following aspects:**
•	What happens in the controller method?
•	How the bean is converted into JSON reponse?
•	In network tab of developer tools show the HTTP header details received
•	In postman click on "Headers" tab to view the HTTP header details received

**1.What happens in the controller method?**
The method getCountryIndia() is called when a GET request is made to /country.

It uses the Spring ApplicationContext to fetch the india bean (which is configured in XML).

The Country object is returned by the method.

Because the class is annotated with @RestController, Spring uses HttpMessageConverters (Jackson JSON converter by default) to automatically serialize the Country object into JSON format in the HTTP response.

**2.How is the bean converted into JSON response?**
Spring Boot includes Jackson (a JSON library).

When the controller returns a Java object, the MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter intercepts the response.

It converts the Java object (Country) into JSON format.

The resulting JSON string is sent as the HTTP response body with Content-Type: application/json.

Example output:

{
  "code": "IN",
  "name": "India"
}

**3. HTTP Headers in Network Tab (Browser Developer Tools)**
When you open browser dev tools (F12) → Network → Click on the /country request, you can observe the HTTP response headers such as:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 29
Date: Sun, 13 Jul 2025 20:00:00 GMT
Content-Type: application/json indicates the server sends JSON data.

Status 200 means OK.

**4. HTTP Headers in Postman (Headers Tab)**
In Postman, after sending the GET request to http://localhost:8085/country:

Go to Headers tab.

You will see response headers like:

Key	            Value
Content-Type	application/json
Content-Length	29
Date	        Sun, 10 Jul 2025 ...
